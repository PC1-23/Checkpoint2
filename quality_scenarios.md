## Availability Scenarios

### Scenario A1: Flash Sale Traffic Overload Protection

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | Multiple concurrent users (1000+ simultaneous requests) |
| **Stimulus** | Users attempt to access flash sale products and checkout during peak sale hours |
| **Environment** | Normal system operation during an active flash sale with high traffic volume |
| **Artifact** | Flash sale checkout endpoint (`/flash/checkout`) |
| **Response** | System applies rate limiting to prevent overload, queuing excessive requests and responding with appropriate HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) status for requests exceeding the limit |
| **Response Measure** | - No more than 5 checkout requests per user per 60-second window are processed<br>- Rate-limited requests receive clear error messages within 100ms<br>- System remains responsive for legitimate requests<br>- No system crashes or downtime occurs |

**Architectural Tactics:**
- **Rate Limiting:** Sliding window algorithm prevents system overload
- **Graceful Degradation:** Users receive informative error messages rather than system failures

**Implementation:**
- `src/flash_sales/rate_limiter.py` - RateLimiter class with sliding window
- `tests/flash_sales/test_rate_limiter.py` - Comprehensive unit tests

### Scenario A2: Payment Service Failure Recovery

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | External payment processing service |
| **Stimulus** | Payment service experiences temporary outage or becomes unresponsive during flash sale checkout |
| **Environment** | High-load conditions during active flash sale with concurrent payment processing attempts |
| **Artifact** | Payment processing function in flash sale checkout flow |
| **Response** | - System detects payment service failures through circuit breaker monitoring<br>- After 3 consecutive failures, circuit opens and prevents further attempts<br>- Failed payment attempts are retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff<br>- Users receive clear error messages indicating payment issues<br>- Circuit automatically attempts to close after 30-second timeout period |
| **Response Measure** | - Circuit breaker opens after 3 failures within 60 seconds<br>- No more than 3 retry attempts per transaction<br>- Circuit breaker timeout of 30 seconds before half-open state<br>- 95% of transient failures recovered through retry mechanism<br>- Users receive response within 5 seconds even when service is down |

**Architectural Tactics:**
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Prevents cascade failures and protects downstream services
- **Retry with Exponential Backoff:** Recovers from transient failures automatically
- **Timeout Management:** Bounded retry attempts prevent indefinite hangs

**Implementation:**
- `src/flash_sales/circuit_breaker.py` - CircuitBreaker class with state management
- `src/flash_sales/retry.py` - Retry decorator with exponential backoff
- `src/flash_sales/payment_resilience.py` - Integration of both tactics
- `tests/flash_sales/test_circuit_breaker.py` - Circuit breaker behavior tests
- `tests/flash_sales/test_retry.py` - Retry logic validation

## Performance Scenarios

### Scenario P1: Bounded Flash Sale Product Listing Latency

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | Multiple users browsing flash sale products |
| **Stimulus** | Users navigate to flash sale product listing page during active sales |
| **Environment** | High concurrent user load (500+ simultaneous users) during peak flash sale hours |
| **Artifact** | Flash sale product listing endpoint (`/flash/products`) |
| **Response** | - System serves flash sale product data from in-memory cache<br>- Cache is populated on first request and refreshed every 30 seconds<br>- Expensive database queries are minimized through caching |
| **Response Measure** | - Product listing page loads in under 200ms for cached requests<br>- Cache hit rate of >90% during flash sale periods<br>- Maximum of 1 database query per 30-second window for product listings<br>- System handles 1000+ requests per second for product listings |

**Architectural Tactics:**
- **Caching:** In-memory cache with TTL-based expiration
- **Read Optimization:** Cache frequently accessed flash sale product data

**Implementation:**
- `src/flash_sales/cache.py` - SimpleCache class with TTL management
- Applied to flash sale routes for product listing optimization

### Scenario P2: Concurrent Checkout Processing

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | Multiple users attempting simultaneous checkout |
| **Stimulus** | 100+ users attempt to purchase flash sale items concurrently during final minutes of sale |
| **Environment** | High-load conditions with limited product inventory |
| **Artifact** | Flash sale checkout transaction processing |
| **Response** | - System processes checkout requests concurrently<br>- Database transactions ensure inventory consistency<br>- Rate limiting prevents system overload from excessive requests<br>- Each successful checkout completes atomically (payment + inventory update) |
| **Response Measure** | - Individual checkout completes in under 2 seconds under normal load<br>- No overselling of products (inventory remains consistent)<br>- Rate limiting maintains <3 second response time under extreme load<br>- System throughput of 50+ successful checkouts per second |

**Architectural Tactics:**
- **Rate Limiting:** Controls request volume to maintain performance
- **Transaction Management:** Ensures data consistency under concurrent access
- **Optimistic Concurrency:** Database-level stock checks prevent overselling

**Implementation:**
- `src/flash_sales/rate_limiter.py` - Checkout endpoint protection
- Database transaction handling in checkout flow
- Stock validation logic in FlashSaleManager

## Testability Scenarios

### Scenario T1: Automated Flash Sale Load Testing

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | Development/QA team |
| **Stimulus** | Developer needs to verify system behavior under flash sale load conditions |
| **Environment** | Test environment with automated test suite |
| **Artifact** | Flash sale module (rate limiter, circuit breaker, retry logic, flash sale manager) |
| **Response** | - Comprehensive unit tests verify each component in isolation<br>- Tests can simulate failure conditions (payment failures, service timeouts)<br>- Tests verify rate limiting behavior under load<br>- Tests confirm circuit breaker state transitions<br>- All tests executable via pytest with no manual intervention |
| **Response Measure** | - 100% code coverage for critical flash sale components<br>- All tests execute in under 30 seconds<br>- Tests can reliably reproduce failure scenarios<br>- Zero flaky tests (consistent pass/fail behavior)<br>- Tests provide clear failure messages for debugging |

**Architectural Tactics:**
- **Unit Testing:** Isolated tests for each component
- **Mocking/Stubbing:** Simulate external dependencies and failure conditions
- **Automated Test Execution:** pytest framework integration
- **Test Fixtures:** Reusable test database and mock objects

**Implementation:**
- `tests/flash_sales/test_rate_limiter.py` - Rate limiter validation
- `tests/flash_sales/test_circuit_breaker.py` - Circuit breaker state tests
- `tests/flash_sales/test_retry.py` - Retry logic verification
- `tests/flash_sales/test_flash_sale_manager.py` - Flash sale business logic tests

## Usability Scenarios

### Scenario U1: Clear Error Feedback for Failed Checkouts

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Source** | End user attempting flash sale purchase |
| **Stimulus** | User encounters error during checkout (rate limit exceeded, payment failure, or out of stock) |
| **Environment** | Normal system operation during flash sale |
| **Artifact** | Flash sale checkout user interface and error handling |
| **Response** | - System provides specific, actionable error messages<br>- User understands why checkout failed<br>- Error messages suggest next steps (e.g., "Please try again in 60 seconds")<br>- No technical jargon or stack traces shown to users |
| **Response Measure** | - Error messages display within 100ms of error occurrence<br>- All error types have user-friendly messages:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Rate limit: "Too many requests. Please wait and try again."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Payment failure: "Payment could not be processed. Please try again or use different payment method."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Out of stock: "This item is no longer available."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Service unavailable: "System experiencing high traffic. Please try again shortly."<br>- 95% of users understand error message without contacting support<br>- Error messages logged for developer debugging while hiding technical details |

**Architectural Tactics:**
- **User-Centered Error Handling:** Friendly, actionable error messages
- **Graceful Degradation:** System remains functional and communicative during failures
- **Separation of Concerns:** Technical error logging separate from user-facing messages

**Implementation:**
- Error handling in `src/flash_sales/routes.py`
- HTTP status codes (429, 503, 400) with descriptive JSON responses
- User-facing error messages in checkout flow
