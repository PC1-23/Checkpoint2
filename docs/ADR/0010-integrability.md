# ADR 0010: Integrability — (Superseded)

Status: Superseded by ADR 0010 (Contract publication) and ADR 0011
(Feed versioning and adapter negotiation).

This ADR was originally a single record for Integrability (contract and
versioning). It has been split into two targeted ADRs:

- `docs/ADR/0010-contract.md` — Contract publication and pre-validation
- `docs/ADR/0011-versioning.md` — Feed versioning and adapter negotiation

See the new ADRs for implementation details and rationale.
