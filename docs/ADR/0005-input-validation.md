# ADR 0005: Input Validation Policy

Status: Accepted

Quality attribute(s): Security

Context
-------
Partner feeds can contain malformed or malicious data. Input validation is
required to prevent data corruption, unexpected exceptions, or injection
attacks.

Decision
--------
Adopt a strict validation-first policy for partner feeds:

- Use existing `validate_products()` to enforce required fields, types and
  value ranges.
- Reject items that fail validation and record failures in the audit table.
- Do not attempt to auto-correct highly malformed input â€” require partner to
  fix and re-submit.

Consequences
------------
- Some partner feeds may be rejected and require partner-side fixes.
- Simplifies security assurances and reduces risk of silent data corruption.

Implementation
--------------
- Code: validation and normalization are implemented in
  `src/partners/partner_ingest_service.py` (`validate_products`,
  `upsert_products`) and parsing/normalization helpers in
  `src/partners/partner_adapters.py` (CSV/JSON parsers produce canonical
  product dicts with `sku`, `name`, `price_cents`, `stock`, and
  `partner_id`).
- Enforcement: the worker (`src/partners/ingest_queue.py`) and sync ingest
  endpoint (`src/partners/routes.py`) call `validate_products` before
  performing upserts. Validation failures are rejected and recorded via
  `record_audit` into `partner_ingest_audit`.
- Rules (high-level):
  - `sku`: non-empty string, max length 128, only printable chars, trimmed.
  - `name`: non-empty string, max length 256, trimmed; remove unusual
    control characters.
  - `price_cents`: integer >= 0; incoming floats are converted using
    rounding rules implemented in the adapters.
  - `stock`: integer >= 0.
  - extra fields are captured in a JSON `extra` column but not trusted for
    business logic unless explicitly whitelisted.

Migration / Production Notes
---------------------------
- Validation logic can be progressively hardened. For back-compat, add a
  'strict' flag on partner profiles so partners can migrate with a grace
  period.
- For large feeds, validate incrementally and report a summary with counts
  of passed/failed rows rather than failing the whole feed. This is an
  optional enhancement for throughput-sensitive partners.

Testing
-------
- Unit tests already exist for adapters and validators. Add tests that
  exercise boundary values (max lengths, negative numbers, non-numeric
  strings for price/stock) in `tests/test_validation.py`.
